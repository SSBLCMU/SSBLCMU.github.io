## About us

Welcome to the Systems and Synthetic Biology Laboratory (SSBL) at Chiang Mai University (CMU). Our laboratory group, situated within the Department of Biology, is at the forefront of cutting-edge research in the field of systems and synthetic biology.

At SSBL, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific exploration by employing the principles of synthetic biology to study, manipulate, and optimize living organisms. Our primary focus lies in utilizing synthetic biology approaches to theoretically analyze, discern, investigate, and optimize the behavior of various organisms. We work with a diverse range of organisms, including microalgae, bacteria, cyanobacteria, extremophiles, droshopkicas, and mitochondria isolates. One of our key objectives is to challenge the limits of life through the lens of systems and synthetic biology. By combining the power of computational modeling, data analysis, and experimental techniques, we strive to generate valuable insights into the fundamental workings of living systems.

Within our laboratory, we employ synthetic biology techniques to create and engineer experimental data sets that aid in understanding and advancing the field of systems biology. By manipulating genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, and cellular processes, we aim to uncover novel approaches for improving biotechnological applications and addressing real-world challenges.

**Lecturer in Systems Biology, BIOL, CMU, Thailand**
**Honorary Research Fellow, GEE, UCL, UK**

Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He was working as a research fellow at University College London before moving back to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for his lecturership in Systems biology.
His current research works include: 
- Investigating physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila
- Metabolic modelling of Euglena for industrial applications
- Astrobiochemistry, modeliing the optimal network fro extraterrestrial conditions.  
- Metabolic analysis in cancer cells

#### Key Skills
- Metabolic flux analysis
- Metabolic network reconstruction and modelling 
- Multi-omics (Metabolomic and transcriptomic) analysis
- Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flow cytometry
- Electron and fluorescence microscopy 
- Drosophila, algal, plant and microbial experiments
