## About us

Welcome to the Systems and Synthetic Biology Laboratory (SSBL) at Chiang Mai University (CMU). Our laboratory group, situated within the Department of Biology, is at the forefront of cutting-edge research in the field of systems and synthetic biology.

At SSBL, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific exploration by employing the principles of synthetic biology to study, manipulate, and optimize living organisms. Our primary focus lies in utilizing synthetic biology approaches to theoretically analyze, discern, investigate, and optimize the behavior of various organisms. We work with a diverse range of organisms, including microalgae, bacteria, cyanobacteria, extremophiles, droshopkicas, and mitochondria isolates. One of our key objectives is to challenge the limits of life through the lens of systems and synthetic biology. By combining the power of computational modeling, data analysis, and experimental techniques, we strive to generate valuable insights into the fundamental workings of living systems.

Within our laboratory, we employ synthetic biology techniques to create and engineer experimental data sets that aid in understanding and advancing the field of systems biology. By manipulating genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, and cellular processes, we aim to uncover novel approaches for improving biotechnological applications and addressing real-world challenges.

### **PACHARA SATTAYAWAT, PhD**
#### Biologist - Microbiologist - Molecular Biologist

**Lecturer in Synthetic Biology, BIOL, CMU, Thailand**

Pachara received her PhD from Imperial College London, UK, in microbial metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Her research focuses on engineering of bacteria and cyanobacteria for enhanced characteristics, including for bioproduction. Her scope starts from system/pathway design, putative protein discovery and all the way to pathway implementation in microbial hosts using synthetic biology-based approaches. To benefit from high cyanobacterial diversity in tropical areas, she recently expanded her research interests to include the characterization of new cyanobacterial strains as robust models for genetic engineering.
