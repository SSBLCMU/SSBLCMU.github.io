## **SAHUTCHAI INWONGWAN (GLA), DPhil**
### Scientist - Biologist - Biochemist

**Lecturer in Systems Biology, BIOL, CMU, Thailand**
**Honorary Research Fellow, GEE, UCL, UK**

Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He was working as a research fellow at University College London before moving back to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for his lecturership in Systems biology.
His current research works include: 
- Investigating physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila
- Metabolic modelling of Euglena for industrial applications
- Astrobiochemistry, modeliing the optimal network fro extraterrestrial conditions.  
- Metabolic analysis in cancer cells
