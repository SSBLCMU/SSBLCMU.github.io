## About us

Welcome to the Systems and Synthetic Biology Laboratory at Chiang Mai University's Department of Biology! Our lab, known as the Systems and Synthetic Biology Laboratory, is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of life through innovative approaches in systems and synthetic biology. We employ theoretical analysis and experimental investigations to determine, understand, optimize, and manipulate various living organisms such as microalgae, bacteria, cyanobacteria, extremophiles, Drosophila melanogaster, and mitochondrial isolates. Our goal is to challenge the limits of life itself under the concept of "Challenging the limits of Life via Systems and Synthetic Biology." Join us as we explore and advance the fascinating world of systems and synthetic biology at Chiang Mai University.

### **SAHUTCHAI INWONGWAN (GLA), DPhil**
#### Scientist - Biologist - Biochemist
**Lecturer in Systems Biology, BIOL, CMU, Thailand**
**Honorary Research Fellow, GEE, UCL, UK**

Sahutchai completed a DPhil (PhD) degree from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford. 
His thesis explored the capacities of Euglena metabolic network using metabolic flux analysis techniques. 
He was working as a research fellow at University College London before moving back to Chiang Mai, Thailand, for his lecturership in Systems biology.
His current research works include: 
- Investigating physiological effects of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in Drosophila
- Metabolic modelling of Euglena for industrial applications
- Astrobiochemistry, modeliing the optimal network fro extraterrestrial conditions.  
- Metabolic analysis in cancer cells
#### Key Skills
- Metabolic flux analysis
- Metabolic network reconstruction and modelling 
- Multi-omics (Metabolomic and transcriptomic) analysis
- Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flow cytometry
- Electron and fluorescence microscopy 
- Drosophila, algal, plant and microbial experiments
